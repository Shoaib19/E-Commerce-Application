# E-Commerce-Application
This is an Fully functioning E-commerce demo application for clothing. I have started this project just out of curiosity as how how e-commerce appication works. I have implemented the backend part too, used firebase as a backend. 

# Things to remember while using this app.

1. It doesn't integrate with Firebase database. You should integrate firabase before using.
2. As it doesn't include firebase, the app will not show any data. You have to manually add data.
3. You have to manually add a admin user details in the firebase realtime database.
4. You also need to add product data by registering as a seller.
